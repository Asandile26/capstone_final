      <p>Welcome to RunIt - a website dedicated to helping people who love to jog and run! We are a team of passionate individuals who understand the importance of staying active and healthy, and we believe that everyone should have access to the right tools and resources to achieve their fitness goals.
Our founder, Asandile Langeni, is a 27-year-old from Khayelitsha who came up with the idea of starting RunIt because he saw a need to help people who want to jog by creating a site that is dedicated to them in order to save them time shopping so that they can spend it on jogging. Asandile is an avid runner himself, and he understands the challenges that people face when it comes to finding the right gear and equipment for their workouts. He wanted to create a platform that would make it easier for people to find what they need so that they can focus on doing what they love - running!

At RunIt, we are dedicated to providing our customers with the best possible experience.</p>
